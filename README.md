# Hey GitHub, my name is Sven - I see myself as a attentive developer.

## I work from Hamburg as a professional web developer with a focus on PHP.

## About me

Since I have always been enthusiastic about computers, I took a training as a PC service and network technician in the mid-90s. During my many years of work as a freelancer, I then joined a project where a project manager urgently needed to improve communication between customers and the developer. As part of this personal development, I got into software development. For the next few years this was limited to FileMaker applications and the installation and maintenance of various websites (Wordpress, Joomla, etc.).

Then in 2016 I did a 6.5-month training course to become a web developer, which also included certification as a Zend Certified PHP Engineer and a Microsoft Specialist in HTML5 with Javascript and CSS3.

Since then, I have been able to gain a lot of experience in different areas. These include e.g., extension of Magento 2 E-Commerce Systems, Laravel and Symfony applications but also various deployment systems such as Jenkins, Drone or GitHub Actions.

During my one and a half year time at a large mobile phone company, I could also expand my frontend knowledge with Angular, NX, Storybook and Tailwind CSS.

I am currently working at a university with a focus on PHP and Symfony.

## Miscellaneous

In my free time, I am very interested in mindfulness and Buddhist philosophy, and I am also interested in music and photography.
